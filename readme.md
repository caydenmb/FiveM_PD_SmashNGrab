# Police Smash Window & Drag Out

A standalone FiveM/QBCore plugin that lets authorized police roles smash vehicle windows and pull occupants out—triggered via a “Third Eye” context menu (hold **Left Alt**) or the `/breakwindow` chat command.

## Features

- 🔨 **Smash & Drag**: Break the correct side window and extract the target from their vehicle.  
- 👮‍♂️ **Role‑Based Access**: Only jobs listed in `config.lua` (default: `police`, `sheriff`) can use it.  
- 🗺️ **Third Eye Menu**: Hold **Left Alt** to open a context menu showing nearby suspects.  
- 📋 **Fallback Command**: Type `/breakwindow` in chat if you prefer.  
- ⚙️ **Fully Configurable**: Adjust distances, job names, seat‑to‑window mappings, exit offsets, and menu ranges.
